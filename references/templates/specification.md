# <SPEC-NAME> — <topic>

> **Normative.** Uses RFC-2119 keywords: **MUST/SHALL** (absolute), **SHOULD** (strong, exceptions need a reason),
> **MAY** (optional). Statements without a keyword are *informative*. Don't implement informative text as a
> requirement; don't relax normative text into a suggestion. Every numbered section carries at least one
> keyword, or it is not normative and does not belong here.

## §1 — <section title>

<a id="section-title-req-area-nnn"></a>
<!-- Stable section anchor. Replace the id with this section's own slug and REQ id — never renumber a
     published §; the id, once cited by a canonical: field, is permanent. -->

<RFC-2119 normative prose stating how the system MUST/SHOULD/MAY behave.>

**Implements:** <REQ-AREA-NNN>

## §2 — <section title>

<a id="section-2-title-req-area-nnn"></a>
<!-- Stable section anchor — see §1. -->

<The same for this section: prose stating what the system MUST, SHOULD or MAY do here.>

**Implements:** <REQ-AREA-NNN>

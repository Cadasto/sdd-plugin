# <ADR-NNNN> — <decision title>

## Status

<proposed | accepted | superseded by ADR-NNNN>  <!-- An ADR is `accepted` before code depends on it. -->

## Context

<The problem and the forces at play, and why this is an irreversible fork worth recording. Do not name the option chosen: that is the Decision. Cite a PR, commit, REQ or STRAND for background, never a plan (plans are deleted at the release sweep).>

## Decision

<The choice taken, stated plainly in one short paragraph. Cite the SPEC § that carries the mechanics; do not restate them.>

## Consequences

<What becomes easier, harder, or permanently constrained — positive and negative. Be honest about the costs.>

## Traceability

- Resolves: <STRAND-NN>           <!-- omit if not resolving an open question -->
- Amends: <REQ-AREA-NNN>, <…>     <!-- the requirements this decision changes -->
